This repository was created when I took the **Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis** course 
on **Algorithmic Bioinformatics** core program. 

This course is given at the [Bioinformatics Institute](https://bioinf.me/en/education) which offers additional education 
based on the [Academic University](http://mit.spbau.ru/en/spbau) of _Russian Academy of Sciences_, SPb.

The author of this course is _Andrey D. Prjibelski_.


Enter **Bioinformatics Institute** too and let's solve these problems!
